## Usage

New users should visit the deployed site to register for an account. Once they have registered for an account, they will be redirected to their "Projects" page and have access to the log into the site on future dates without the need to register again. Once on the "Projects" page, uses will be able to view information about planets, make notes about the populated planet information, give their notes a project title, and then save their project for future use.
